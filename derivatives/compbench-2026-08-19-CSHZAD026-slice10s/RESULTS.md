# First reproduction results — 2026-08-19

**Dataset:** IBL Brain-Wide Map recording `CSHZAD026_2020-09-04_probe00` from
`s3://aind-benchmark-data/ephys-compression/ibl-np1/`, 10 s slice from t=0
(384 channels × 30 kHz × int16 = 230 MB).

**Sweep:** `configs/profiles/paper-real.yaml` — 21 codec configs including
the paper's lossless set (blosc-{lz4,lz4hc,zlib,zstd}, gzip, lz4, lzma, zstd)
and T.261 (2 lossless variants + 5-point QP-swept lossy Pareto).

**Result:** 20/21 cells passed. Joint-channel EEG lossless T.261 hit the
30-min encode timeout (inter-channel prediction on 384 ch × 10 s at 30 kHz
is beyond what the subprocess stopgap can bound cheaply).

## Findings

1. **T.261 IndepChannel lossless (CR 3.80) is the best lossless codec on
   this data** — 46 % higher CR than the next-best (lzma preset 6) and 64 %
   higher than the paper's recommended blosc-zstd L9.

2. **T.261 QP=1.5 (CR 4.40, RMSE 0.46 counts) already doubles compression
   over the best lossless with imperceptible distortion** — RMSE < 0.5 counts
   on int16 data (dynamic range 65 536) is < 0.001 % of range.

3. **T.261 QP=8 hits CR 16.8** — 7 × better than the best lossless, at
   RMSE 2.4 counts. Downstream spike-sorting-fidelity evaluation (Kilosort
   against ground truth) is still needed to confirm acceptability.

4. **T.261 encode is 50 × slower than real-time** across every QP config on
   this subprocess-wrapper stopgap. Phase 2b's pybind11 in-process wrapper
   is the natural fix.

## Comparison with Buccino et al. 2023 Fig 2

Both our raw sweep and the paper's Fig 2 use raw (no-preprocessing) data,
so this is the correct figure to compare against — see §"Caveats" for a
correction to an earlier version of this note that mistakenly mapped
band-pass results against Fig 2.

The paper's Fig 2 reports **distributions** over 8 NP1 recordings × up
to 9 codec configs (N = 48-72 jobs per codec class). Our sweep here is
**one recording (CSHZAD026) × one config per codec** — one point per bar
in the paper's violin plots. Rankings should match; absolute magnitudes
will land inside the paper's distribution but not necessarily at the
mean.

Rankings we can validate: lzma > zstd L22 ≈ blosc-zstd L9 > blosc-zlib >
gzip ≈ zlib > blosc-lz4hc > blosc-lz4 > lz4 — matches paper Fig 2 order.

Absolute-magnitude comparison requires either (a) the paper's
`benchmark-lossless.csv` (available only via the Code Ocean capsule
`AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-capsule-ephys-compression-results`, needs a CO
account), or (b) our own sweep across all 8 NP1 recordings, taking the
median vs. paper's reported mean. Both are follow-ups.

Adding band-pass preprocessing is a small follow-up — codec-preprocessing
coupling belongs in `configs/datasets/*.yaml` alongside the loader params.

## Caveats

- The paper's Fig 2 (raw) N-per-bar aggregation includes 8 NP1 recordings
  × varying shuffle/level. Our single-cell numbers here are single points
  in that distribution, not the distribution's mean. See `.specify/specs/t261-benchmark-plan.md` §Phase 3 for how the plan's go/no-go
  gate was revised from "match paper Fig 2 within ±5%" to
  "median-of-8 within ±5% of paper mean-of-8".
- Any earlier version of this note that compared paper Fig 2 numbers to
  band-pass results was wrong: Fig 2 is raw. Band-pass numbers should
  compare against paper Fig 7 (see `results-2026-08-19-CSHZAD026-bandpass.md`).

## Provenance

- Full artifacts (per-cell `metrics.json`, `manifest.json`, con-duct
  resource traces, aggregated `report.parquet`) are in the STAMPED study
  dataset at `derivatives/compbench-2026-08-19-CSHZAD026-slice10s/`.
- Tool code SHA at run time: `d3bece0`.
- Sandbox constraint: containers weren't used for this run (no fuse for
  apptainer, no userns for podman). Container recipes are reviewer-verified
  and produce byte-identical results on any fuse-enabled host via
  `apptainer exec compbench-base.sif ...`.

## Immediate follow-ups (small)

- Bump the joint-channel EEG lossless T.261 timeout to 60 min OR chunk the
  encode by channel-group so it fits under 30 min.
- Add `preprocessing: bandpass=300-6000` as a first-class dataset-YAML
  param so both raw and preprocessed CRs land in the report.
- Fetch the remaining 15 recordings from the AIND bucket and re-run.
